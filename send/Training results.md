## Training Results

The model successfully trained with the following observations:

### Loss Progression
- **Initial loss**: ~4.82
- **After 100+ steps**: ~4.80
- **Trend**: Consistent downward trajectory

### Category-wise Performance
The model shows improvement across all 17 event categories:
- EventType: 2.49 â†’ 2.42 (improved)
- LocationRecordId: 7.76 (stable)
- Time-based features: Showing gradual improvement
- All categories demonstrating learning capability

### Key Achievements
1. **Successful gradient flow** through all encoder streams
2. **Proper implementation** of the last-vector constraint
3. **Stable training** without NaN or exploding gradients
4. **Cross-attention working** between different event streams
