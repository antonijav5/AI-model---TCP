## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **EventEncoder**: Handles multi-category event embedding with learnable representations
2. **Entity-Specific Encoders**: Separate transformer encoders for each event stream type
3. **EventPredictor**: Transformer decoder with cross-attention to encoded states
4. **Training Pipeline**: Supports gradient accumulation, checkpointing, and TensorBoard logging with proper GPU optimization

## Technical Decisions

### Model-Level
- **Only last encoder vectors**: Efficient information bottleneck preserving temporal causality as per requirements
- **Separate encoders**: Specialized learning for each entity type (Actor, Location, Time) enabling modular stream-specific context
- **Cross-attention mechanism**: Contextual fusion across different encoded modalities for richer representations
- **Multi-category prediction**: Simultaneous prediction of 17 event categories (EventType, ActorRecordId, etc.) with individual loss tracking
- **Teacher forcing**: Uses target sequences shifted by one position for next-token prediction during training

### Architecture Issues Identified & Fixed
- **Forward/Backward separation**: Fixed improper backward() calls within forward() method that disrupted PyTorch's autograd system
- **Loss aggregation**: Changed from mean to sum of category losses to preserve gradient magnitude
- **GPU data transfer**: Moved tensor device conversion from forward pass to data loading pipeline
- **Tensor vs float returns**: Forward method now returns tensors (not floats) to maintain gradient computation graph

### Optimization & Training
- **Mixed precision (bfloat16)**: GPU memory efficiency with automatic mixed precision support
- **Gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)**: Prevents exploding gradients across all training steps
- **Adaptive learning rate**: ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler with factor=0.5, patience=3 for automatic convergence optimization  
- **Proper backward pass**: Separated from forward method, called explicitly in training loop with gradient accumulation
- **Category-wise loss tracking**: Individual monitoring of all 17 prediction categories for detailed training insights

### Infrastructure & GPU Optimization
- **CUDA device management**: Proper tensor conversion and device placement for GPU training
- **Memory optimization**: Efficient batch processing with gradient accumulation (batch_size=1, accum=8)
- **TensorBoard integration**: Comprehensive logging of total loss, per-category losses, timing metrics, and learning rate changes
- **Docker GPU support**: Configured with nvidia runtime and proper device reservations
- **Checkpointing system**: Automatic saving of best models and regular checkpoints with error handling
