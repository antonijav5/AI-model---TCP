# Implementation Details

## Key Components

- **EventEncoder**: Handles multi-category event representations using learnable embeddings  
- **Entity-Specific Encoders**: Dedicated Transformer encoders for each stream type (Actor, Location, Time)  
- **EventPredictor**: Transformer decoder with cross-attention to encoded states  
- **Training Pipeline**: Supports gradient accumulation, checkpointing, and TensorBoard logging with GPU optimization  

## Technical Decisions

### Model-Level

- **Last-layer-only encoder vectors**: Efficient bottleneck preserving temporal causality  
- **Separate encoders per entity**: Modular specialization for each context stream  
- **Cross-attention mechanism**: Enables rich fusion of multi-modal contextual embeddings  
- **Multi-category prediction**: Simultaneous prediction of 17 categories (EventType, ActorRecordId, etc.) with per-category loss tracking  
- **Teacher forcing**: Uses one-step-shifted target sequences during training  

### Architectural Fixes and Improvements

- **Separated forward/backward logic**: Removed `backward()` from `forward()` method; now called explicitly in training loop  
- **Loss aggregation**: Uses sum instead of mean to preserve gradient magnitude  
- **GPU tensor transfer**: Tensor conversion moved to data loading phase  
- **Tensor return values**: `forward()` now returns tensors to preserve autograd graph  

## Optimization and Training

- **Mixed precision (bfloat16)**: Improved memory usage and training speed  
- **Gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)**: Prevents exploding gradients  
- **Adaptive learning rate**: `ReduceLROnPlateau` with factor=0.5 and patience=3  
- **Explicit backward pass**: Called in training loop for proper autograd flow  
- **Per-category loss**: Detailed monitoring for all 17 output categories  

## Infrastructure and GPU Optimization

- **CUDA device handling**: Proper tensor conversion and placement on GPU  
- **Memory optimization**: `batch_size=1` with `gradient_accumulation=8`  
- **TensorBoard integration**: Logs total and per-category loss, time, and LR changes  
- **Docker GPU support**: Uses NVIDIA runtime and device allocation  
- **Checkpoint system**: Automatically saves best-performing and periodic model checkpoints with error handling

## Current Performance Status

### Training Metrics

- **Loss (current)**: ~85 (GPU, bfloat16) vs ~4 (CPU baseline) â€” under investigation  
- **Per-category loss**:  
  - EventType: 3.3  
  - ActorRecordId: 7.8  
  - LocationRecordId: 7.6  
  - ... (full breakdown available via TensorBoard)

- **Training speed**: ~2â€“3 seconds per batch with full GPU utilization  
- **Memory usage**: Optimized for single GPU with gradient accumulation  

## Next Optimization Steps

- **Precision comparison**: Compare bfloat16 vs float32 convergence behavior  
- **LR tuning**: Test smaller learning rate (e.g., `1e-4`) for better stability  
- **Data shuffling**: Enable shuffling during training for improved generalization  
- **Gradient monitoring**: Add logging for gradient norms for diagnostics
