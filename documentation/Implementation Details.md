## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **EventEncoder**: Handles multi-category event embedding with learnable representations
2. **Entity-Specific Encoders**: Separate transformer encoders for each event stream type
3. **EventPredictor**: Transformer decoder with cross-attention to encoded states
4. **Training Pipeline**: Supports gradient accumulation, checkpointing, and TensorBoard logging

### Model Configuration
```json
{
    "src_seq_len": 50,
    "tgt_seq_len": 50,
    "id_category_size": 1000,
    "epochs": 100,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "grad_accum": 2,
    "model_checkpoint": null,
    "model": {
        "d_model": 64,
        "num_heads": 8,
        "encoder_layers": 3,
        "decoder_layers": 3
    }
}
```

## Technical Decisions

1. **Only last encoder vectors**: Implemented as required, creating an efficient information bottleneck
2. **Separate encoders**: Allows specialized learning for each entity type
3. **Mish activation**: Chosen for smoother gradients compared to ReLU
4. **CPU optimizations**: Removed multiprocessing overhead, adjusted precision

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Memory constraints with workers | Set `num_workers=0`, disabled persistent workers |
| Docker container space issues | Optimized batch processing, shared volumes |
| Dimension mismatches | Careful tensor reshaping in encoder aggregation |
| CPU training speed | Increased batch size, optimized data loading |

## Conclusions

The implementation successfully demonstrates:
1. **Understanding of transformer architectures** applied to event sequences
2. **Ability to handle complex multi-stream inputs** with proper attention mechanisms
3. **Practical problem-solving** in adapting the model for local CPU training
4. **Clean, modular code** that follows PyTorch best practices

The model learns to predict future events by maintaining entity states through their event histories, exactly as intended by the challenge design.
