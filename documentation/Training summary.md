# üîç Model Training Summary

## Model Architecture

This project implements a **multi-stream transformer encoder-decoder architecture** using PyTorch, designed for event sequence prediction with the following key features:

* **Multi-stream input processing**: Separate event feature streams (Employee, Location, Time, etc.)
* **Dedicated encoders per stream**: Independent representation learning for each entity type
* **Cross-attention decoder**: Integrates and contextualizes representations across all event streams
* **Multi-category prediction heads**: Simultaneous prediction of 17 event categories
* **Last-vector constraint**: Uses only final encoder states for efficient sequential prediction
* **Teacher forcing training**: Next-token prediction with shifted target sequences

## Observed Training Progress (Epochs 0‚Äì4)

| Epoch | Train Loss | Val Loss   | Best Val | Time   | Notes                          |

### Validation Loss Trend

Gradual decrease over 5 epochs. Best validation loss achieved in epoch 4: `85.866`.

### Category Loss Insight

* `IsTimesheet`: \~0.85 ‚Äî very easy to learn
* `HoursWorked`: \~6.6 ‚Äî complex, contextual
* `EventType`, `ActorRecordId`, `RecipientRecordId`: \~3.2‚Äì7.8
* Temporal fields (`Time_Reference_*`, `Time_Event_*`): 2.8‚Äì5.9

## Technical Achievements & Debugging

### ‚úÖ Implemented

* Multi-stream transformer with cross-attention
* GPU training with gradient accumulation and clipping
* Per-category loss tracking and logging
* Checkpointing with best-model saving
* TensorBoard integration & Docker-based deployment

### üîß Issues Resolved

* Fixed misplaced `backward()` call
* Corrected loss accumulation logic
* Tracked per-category losses correctly
* Moved device transfers to data loading
* Ensured forward pass returns tensors
* ‚úÖ Replaced mini-batch loss averaging:

  ```python
  mini_batch_loss = torch.mean(torch.stack(category_losses))
  if run_backward:
      mini_batch_loss.backward()
  loss_sum += mini_batch_loss.item()
  ```

  with direct category loss accumulation (`sum(category_losses)`), avoiding an extra mean operation
